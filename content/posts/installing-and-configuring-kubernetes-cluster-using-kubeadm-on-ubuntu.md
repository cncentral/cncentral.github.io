There are many ways to install and configure a Kubernetes cluster for learning and development purposes. We can use [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/), [Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io/), [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/), or [microk8s](https://microk8s.io/) to quickly create a single-node cluster for our development work. These are good for quick development work but not so much when we need a multi-node cluster with additional services. For such a scenario, we can use virtual machines and configure a Kubernetes cluster using [kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/). 

This article examines the steps necessary to set up a virtual Kubernetes cluster. 

### Virtual machine configuration

We can create four Ubuntu 22.04 LTS virtual machines (cloud-based or on a local system) to ensure the cluster has enough resources. Each of these VMs is configured with two virtual CPUs and 2GB of virtual memory. It is recommended to configure each virtual machine with a static IP address. In the case of a local virtualization environment, we should create an external virtual switch to enable Internet connectivity within the Ubuntu guest OS. We use one of these four VMs as the control plane node and the other three as worker nodes.

### Container runtime

Kubernetes uses a Container Runtime Interface (CRI) compliant container runtime to orchestrate containers in Pods.

Many runtimes are supported within Kubernetes. The most popular ones include Docker (via [cri-dockerd](https://github.com/Mirantis/cri-dockerd)), [containerd](https://containerd.io/), and [CRI-O](https://cri-o.io/). The choice of a runtime depends on several factors, such as performance, isolation needs, and security. We shall use [containerd](https://containerd.io/) as the runtime for this virtual cluster.

### Container Network Interface (CNI)

Kubernetes requires a CNI-compatible Pod network addon for Pods within the cluster to communicate with each other. We can choose from many [open-source and commercial CNI plugins](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/#networking-and-network-policy) to implement the Pod network. Once again, we must consider factors such as ease of deployment, performance, security, and resource consumption to choose the Pod network addon correct for our Kubernetes cluster and the workload we plan to run.

For this article, we choose [Calico](https://www.tigera.io/project-calico/) as the pod network addon for the ease of deployment.

### Preparing control plane and worker nodes

Each node in the Kubernetes cluster has the following components.

- A container runtime
- Kubectl - The command line interface to Kubernetes API
- Kubelet - Agent on each node that receives work from the scheduler
- Kubeadm - Tool to automate deployment and configuration of a Kubernetes cluster

Before going into this, we must ensure that nodes that will be a part of the Kubernetes cluster can communicate with each other and the firewall ports required for node-to-node communication are open.

The following network ports must be open for inbound TCP traffic on the control plane node. 

- 6443
- 2379:2380
- 10250
- 10257
- 10259
- 179 (required for Calico)

On the worker nodes, we should configure to allow incoming TCP traffic on the following ports.

- 10250
- 30000:32767

On Ubuntu, we can use `ufw` command to perform this configuration.

```shell
sudo ufw allow proto tcp from any to any port 6443,2379,2380,10250,10257,10259,179
```

To see the bridged traffic, we must disable swap and configure IPv4 forwarding and IP tables on each node. Before all this, ensure each node has the latest and greatest packages. We will need `curl` as well on the node to download certain packages.

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl
```

We must disable swap on each node that will be a part of the Kubernetes cluster.

```shell
sudo swapoff -a
sudo sed -i '/^\/swap\.img/s/^/#/' /etc/fstab
```

We must also check if the swap is listed in the `/etc/fstab` and either comment or remove the line.

Next, configure IPv4 forwarding and IP tables on each node.

```shell
#Enable IP tables to bridge traffic on all nodes
# https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/#forwarding-ipv4-and-letting-iptables-see-bridged-traffic
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/k8s.conf
overlay
br_netfilter
EOF

sudo modprobe overlay
sudo modprobe br_netfilter

# sysctl params required by setup, params persist across reboots
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/k8s.conf
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables  = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
net.ipv4.ip_forward                 = 1
EOF

# Apply sysctl params without reboot
sudo sysctl --system
```

#### Installing containerd

The next set of commands download the latest release of containerd from GitHub and configure it. We need to run this on each node.

```shell
CONTAINERD_VERSION="1.7.4"
RUNC_VERSION="1.1.9"
CNI_PLUGINS_VERSION="1.3.0"

# Install containerd
curl -Lo /tmp/containerd-${CONTAINERD_VERSION}-linux-amd64.tar.gz \
         https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/download/v${CONTAINERD_VERSION}/containerd-${CONTAINERD_VERSION}-linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo tar Cxzvf /usr/local /tmp/containerd-${CONTAINERD_VERSION}-linux-amd64.tar.gz

# Install runc
curl -Lo /tmp/runc.amd64 https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/download/v${RUNC_VERSION}/runc.amd64
sudo install -m 755 /tmp/runc.amd64 /usr/local/sbin/runc

# clean up containerd and runc files
rm -rf /tmp/containerd-${CONTAINERD_VERSION}-linux-amd64.tar.gz /tmp/runc.amd64

# install containerd config
sudo mkdir -p /etc/containerd
containerd config default | sudo tee /etc/containerd/config.toml
sudo sed -i 's/SystemdCgroup = false/SystemdCgroup = true/' /etc/containerd/config.toml
sudo curl -Lo /etc/systemd/system/containerd.service https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containerd/cri/master/contrib/systemd-units/containerd.service  
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now containerd
sudo systemctl status containerd --no-pager

# Install CNI plugins
curl -Lo /tmp/cni-plugins-amd64-v${CNI_PLUGINS_VERSION}.tgz \
         https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases/download/v${CNI_PLUGINS_VERSION}/cni-plugins-linux-amd64-v${CNI_PLUGINS_VERSION}.tgz
sudo mkdir -p /opt/cni/bin
sudo tar Cxzvf /opt/cni/bin /tmp/cni-plugins-amd64-v${CNI_PLUGINS_VERSION}.tgz

# clean up CNI plugins
rm -rf /tmp/cni-plugins-amd64-v${CNI_PLUGINS_VERSION}.tgz
```

#### Installing kubeadm, kubelet, and kubectl

These three tools are needed on each node.

```shell
sudo curl -fsSL https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.28/deb/Release.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg

echo 'deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.28/deb/ /' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl
```

The above commands download and install the three tools we need on each node. Once installed, we mark the packages as held so they don't get automatically upgraded or removed.

#### Initialize Kubernetes cluster

Once the prerequisite configuration is complete, we can initialize the Kubernetes cluster using `kubeadm init` command.

```shell
IPADDR=$(hostname -I)
APISERVER=$(hostname -s)
NODENAME=$(hostname -s)
POD_NET="10.244.0.0/16"

sudo kubeadm init --apiserver-advertise-address=$IPADDR \
                  --apiserver-cert-extra-sans=$APISERVER \
                  --pod-network-cidr=$POD_NET \
                  --node-name $NODENAME
```

This command starts a few preflight checks and the necessary Pods to start the Kubernetes control plane. At the end of successful execution, we will see output similar to what is shown here.

```shell
Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

You should now deploy a Pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  /docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of machines by running the following on each node
as root:

  kubeadm join <control-plane-host>:<control-plane-port> --token <token> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<hash>
```

Before proceeding or clearing the screen output, copy the `kubeadm join` command. We need this to join the worker nodes to the Kubernetes cluster.

#### Prepare kubeconfig

Before installing the Pod network addon, we need to make sure we prepare the `kubectl` config file. `kubeadm init` command provides the necessary commands to do this.

```shell
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
```

Once this is done, verify if the Kubernetes control plane objects can be queried.

```shell
kubectl get nodes
```

This command will show only the control plane node and be shown as `NotReady`. This is because the Pod network is not ready. We can now install the Pod network addon.

#### Installing Calico

Installing Calico is just two steps. First, we install the operator.

```shell
curl -Lo /tmp/tigera-operator.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.24.5/manifests/tigera-operator.yaml
kubectl create -f /tmp/tigera-operator.yaml
```

Next, we need to install the custom resources.

```shell
curl -Lo /tmp/custom-resources.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.24.5/manifests/custom-resources.yaml
```

In this YAML, we must modify the `spec.calicoNetwork.ipPools.cidr` to match what we specified as the argument to `--pod-network-cidr`. Once this modification is complete, we can implement the custom resources.

```shell
CIDR='10.244.0.0/16'
sed -i "s|192.168.0.0/16|$CIDR|" /tmp/custom-resources.yaml
kubectl create -f /tmp/custom-resources.yaml
```

We need to wait for the Calico Pods to transition to the Ready state before proceeding toward joining the worker nodes to the cluster.

```shell
$ watch kubectl get pods -n calico-system
```

Once all Calico pods in the calico-system namespace are online and ready, we can check if the control plane node is in a ready state or not using the `kubectl get nodes` command.

Finally, we can move on to joining all worker nodes in the cluster. we must run the command we copied from the `kubeadm init` command on each worker node.

```shell
$ kubeadm join IP:6443 --token token \
        --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash hash
```

> **Note**: IP, token, and hash in the copied command will differ.

The node joining process takes a few minutes. We can run the `watch kubectl get nodes` command on the control plane node, wait until all nodes come online, and transition to the ready state.

```shell
$ kubectl get nodes
NAME       STATUS   ROLES           AGE     VERSION
cplane01   Ready    control-plane   4h42m   v1.28.1
node01     Ready    <none>          4h28m   v1.28.1
node02     Ready    <none>          4h28m   v1.28.1
node03     Ready    <none>          4h28m   v1.28.1
```

We should also verify whether all control plane pods are online and ready.

```shell
$ kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
NAMESPACE          NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS        AGE

```

This is it. We now have a four-node Kubernetes cluster that we can use for our learning, development, and production too!
